* MetaCall Common Lisp library

A Common Lisp [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface][foreign function interface (FFI)]] for [[https://metacall.io/][MetaCall]], which is
an extensible, embeddable and interoperable cross-platform polyglot
runtime. It supports NodeJS, Vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
Ruby, C#, Go, C, C++, Rust, D, Cobol and more.

It uses [[https://github.com/cffi/cffi][CFFI/C2FFI]] to automatically generate the CFFI definitions, so it's a
complete interface based on the C header files.

*NOTE: this software is in pre-alpha state. You are better off NOT
using it, but to wait for a more stable version!*
